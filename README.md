# tic-tac-toe-js

Tic-tac-toe game made with Javascript as part of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe)  
This was mainly an exercise to familiarize myself with factory functions and further explore what Bootstrap can do. I went with a minimalist style just to experiment.
